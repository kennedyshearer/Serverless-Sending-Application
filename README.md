## 🔧 Tools Used  
| Tool            | Description |
|----------------|------------|
| **Amazon S3** | A cloud storage service that lets users store and retrieve data online. |
| **Amazon API Gateway** | A fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. |
| **AWS Lambda** | A service that lets you run code without managing servers. |
| **AWS Step Functions** | Lets you coordinate individual tasks into a visual workflow. |
| **Simple Notification Service (SNS)** | A web service that coordinates and manages the delivery or sending of messages to subscribing endpoints or clients. |
| **Simple Email Service (SES)** | A cloud-based email service provider that can integrate into any application for high-volume email automation. |
| **HTML** | Hypertext Markup Language used to build up website's front end. |

## Create a Lambda Role

Lambda interacts with SES, SNS, Step Functions which means a Lambda Role must be created with executioon rights for these services.

First, go to **IAM**, and select **Roles** on the left panel, then **Create Role**:

Next, select **AWS service** as the **Trusted entity type** and **Lambda** as the **Use case**:

Continue and a menu permissions will appear:

Now search for the name of each service that will be used, and select *Full Access* rights in order to send instructions and information to the services.

> It is best practice to refine the permissions by using only the rights necessary for the actions you want to do with the services, and to do this you must create our own permissions. Here, to facilitate the execution of the project, the *Full Access* permissions created by default by AWS are used.

Add the *Full Access* permissions of SES:

Add the *Full Access* permissions of SNS:

![SNS Permissions](https://i.gyazo.com/33ea90095d45f7cb25239c51cf793539.png)

Add the *Full Access* permissions of Step Functions:

![Step functions Permissions](https://i.gyazo.com/95c07c8f32f05844fde7633899fe6f31.png)

Only task left in this section is to validate and create the Lambda Role with the desired name:

Once the Lambda Role has been created, it is time to create the first Lambda function: *email.py*.
